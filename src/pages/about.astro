  <p>
	Hello! I'm Priyal Patel, a London-based artist passionate about exploring the intersection of creativity and emotion. My work spans painting, digital art, and mixed media, each piece reflecting a unique journey and perspective rooted in my experiences in London and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
	Art, for me, is a way to connect with others and express the stories that words cannot capture. I find inspiration in nature, urban landscapes, and the everyday moments that often go unnoticed throughout this vibrant city. Through my portfolio and blog, I share not only finished works but also sketches, thoughts, and the process behind each creation.
  </p>
  <p>
	Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope my work inspires you to see beauty in the ordinary and to pursue your own creative path.
